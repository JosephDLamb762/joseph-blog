  <h1>Is It Possible To Be Loo Late To Buy a Stock?</h1>
  <p><em>Published on April 4th 2025</em></p>
  <h2>Addressing The Question:</h2>
  <p>   No would be my answer to this question. In the case of rational investing based on evaluating the company against its current market value, I wouldn't say that you can be too late to buy something. That certainly doesn't feel like the case when you look at charts that show absurd growth of over 1000% that pops up every now and then thanks to regulatory changes or the Wall Street Bets short squeeze of Gamestop. You are likely to see the graph of that stock and reasonably think to yourself “I'm too late.”. This sentiment is likely amplified when you hear people say things like “If you invested $100 in Coca Cola in 1919 you'd have…”. The first thing we should realize is that most people who were alive when Coca Cola IPO'd in 1919 aren't alive today. The next thing to realize is that people are still invested in Coca Cola today. In the past year, from the time that I am writing this, Coke's stock is up 62%. I don't think the people who invested in Coke a year ago are upset that the stock isn't up 10,000% as 62% growth beats the market by a sizable amount. At the end of the day, you can't say for certain if a stock will go up or down or by how much (obviously), but you can still make rational investments with high likelihood for positive returns. You can invest in a stock for many different reasons ranging from essentially gambling to trying to slowly build long-term wealth. Each person's goals are different which means that they might adapt different investment strategies. You might invest in gold if you want to hedge against inflation, you could buy Consumer Staples stocks if you think we're going into a recession, you could put all your money in the S&P if you simply don't want to think about it, or you can invest in a stock like NVIDIA if you think AI is going to be the next biggest thing.</p>
  <h2>The Case for NVIDIA:</h2>
  <p>   NVIDIA is one of these stocks that has had absurd growth in recent years, but not for the traditional reasons one might think. There was no regulatory change, and it didn't become a meme stock. NVIDIA is a tech company and a very popular choice for someone looking to jump on AI. A reasonable question to ask here is how many people actually know what NVIDIA does and how they make money, and how many people are just speculating on the movement of the price? If a sizable amount of people are speculating to make some quick cash, many would call it a bubble, and it can happen for many reasons. For a stock like NVIDIA where most people know at least the name, fear of missing out or FOMO is top of that list. The hot-hands fallacy can seriously feed into the disconnect of the value of the company and its share price. This fallacy is the mistaken belief that past uncertain events gives you some certainty about future events despite them being independent. In terms of a stock, the share price has been going up and therefore it will continue to go up. There are many tools an investor might use to determine if a stock is overvalued or unvalued. One of these tools is a Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E). It measures the market value of the company against its earnings. A way to think about this number is how much investors are willing to pay for a share per dollar earned by the company. NVIDIA's P/E as of the time that this was written is about 37. To put that number in context of other tech companies, the P/E ratio for Apple, Microsoft, and Broadcom are about 35, 30, and 76 respectively. This number is also a good indication of how much investors believe that companies' earnings will grow moving forward. As we learn more about what AI excels at and what its limitations are, this outlook could change drastically. It's possible that the type of chip that NVIDIA produces is not as effective as that of Texas Instruments which makes an entirely different type of chip. If you think this evaluation is too low then you could invest, and with the possibilities of AI it's certainly not out of the question. You could also join many others in saying that there is an AI bubble driven purely by speculation on the movement of price.</p>
  <h2>The Takeaway:</h2>
  <p>   At the end of the day, it is up to each investor to decide whether the current share price matches the value of the company, and they can invest accordingly. The catch is that there is no certain right answer. I could come up with an investment thesis that would lead me to believe the stock would go up. I could be right and the stock could still go down because of something else that I couldn't have known was going to happen. To maximize the likelihood that this doesn't happen, however, one should learn as much about the company as possible. That includes understanding the current value of the company against its share price. That would indicate that there is no such thing as too late to buy, but instead it just might not make sense to buy right now.</p>
